intro: The old site was quickly dying the painful death often seen where sites suffer from a chronic case of IBM WebSphere. The end was near.

So we needed to move quickly. Everything had to be done before the WebSphere license expired.

__Everything.__

New UX, new design, integrations to other systems, frontend, backend, search, content migrations. Yes. All of it.
Working really agile and close to the client and UX and Design in intense sprints, we pulled it off. The new site went live on the said date, without even a hickup.

One of the biggest challenges of this project was combining all requirements - how to make such a large site responsive and great looking while at the same time meeting the accessibility requirements. Being agile and modularized in this project truly helped us reach this goal.
