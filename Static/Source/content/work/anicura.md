AniCura is a rather new brand in the animal healthcare business on the scandinavian markets. It consists of a number of previously independent clinics, now gathered under one brand.

To consolidate all online communications, AniCura needed web sites for each scandinavian market and all clinics in those markets.

The sites needed to be flexible both in terms of reusable components and in responsive behaviour across devices. The customer had already decided on EPiServer 7.5 as their CMS so we went with MVC and Razor to easily let our frontend and backend developers work independently with clear cut responsibility. The EPiServer functionality was more or less built by the book, with the exception of some extra API:s. By using content blocks and leveraging the MVC pattern we managed to maintain the high flexibility required.

AngularJS was selected as JavaScript framework and structural capital was built on Google Custom Search API to enhance the site search.
