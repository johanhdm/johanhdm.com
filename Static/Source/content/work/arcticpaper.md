intro: Last time I saw this site was in 2006 and it was gorgeous. Tables and all. And here I was, at my new job being confronted with my old sins.

So it was time to upgrade the site. The tables had to go. EPiServer 4.52 was not in fashion anymore. Flash didn't work on iPhones. What to do?

The UX and design teams did an amazing job - rational and beautiful - getting it into place was up to the tech team.

Since the customer already was on EPiServer we went for EPiServer CMS 6 with Composer 4 modules. Of course the site had to be responsive and adapted to loads of different markets.
